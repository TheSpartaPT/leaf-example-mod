# Example Mod

## Setup

- Clone or 'Download ZIP' the repository
- Download the JDK version that the game version you are modding uses. Most of the time it will be `>=17` for game versions `41.78.16` and higher.
- Once gradle is initialised/setup and the IDE is idling, you can use `genSourcesWithX` to generate decompiled game sources with any listed decompiler of your choosing. If you do not know which one to use, run `genSources` to use the default decompiler set by loom.

Leaf is a mostly-accurate port to Zomboid, so most if not all of the principals and funamentals for mod setup apply.
