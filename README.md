# Example Mod

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric documentation page](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/getting-started/setting-up-a-development-environment) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
You can use the fabric page because Leaf is a mostly-accurate port to Zomboid, so all of the principals and other things apply.
